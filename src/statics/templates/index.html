          HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is
          used to design the web pages. With the help of HTML,
          you can create a complete website structure. HTML
          is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
          Hypertext defines the link between the web pages
          and markup language defines the text document within
          the tag that define the structure of web pages.

          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to styles web
          pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred
          to as CSS. The reason for using this is to simplify
          the process of making web pages presentable. It allows
          you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly,
          it enables you to do this independently of the HTML
          that makes up each web page.

          ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible
          JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
          It is an open-source, component-based front-end
          library that is responsible only for the view layer
          of the application. ReactJS is not a framework, it
          is just a library developed by Facebook to solve
          some problems that we were facing earlier.
